Jim Holland Analysis HW-6
Observation 1: Although cities at Equator might not have the highest temperature, 
their temperatures remain high (around 80 F-Degree); 
North Sphere had more data when approaching the polar, 
this is due to the fact that there are barely any cities/countries existed passing the Antarctic 
Circle (60ish degree) at the South Sphere. 
From the trend of "City Latitude vs. Max Temperature" graph, 
the temperature climbs up when approaching from both side of the Polars to the Equator.

Observation 2: From graph "City Latitude vs Humidity", 
humidities varies among cities even at the same Latitude. 
There are more than just latitude affecting the humidity (i.e. geographic location). 
However, we did saw that the humidity among cities around equator retain relatively moderate-to-high-humidity (40%-100%). 
This could mainly be caused by the constant hot weather around equator area.

Observation 3: From graph "City Latitude vs Wind Speed", 
The wind speeds for cities around Equator below 20mph. However, temperature 
(due to the constantly high temperature around Equator) is just one of the many factors that affecting the Wind Speed. 
Thus the correlation might seems a bit low.
